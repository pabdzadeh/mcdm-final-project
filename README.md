# Multiple-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) Course Final Project Implementation
 
In this project I tried to implement the model presented in the 2021 paper "Effective link prediction in multiplex networks A TOPSIS method" [1]. 
For this implementation to work correctly, you need to first clone PyDecisions from https://github.com/Valdecy/pyDecisions . It is also worth mentioning that not all the datasets used
in this project exactly are the same as the ones employed by paper authors (the last three datasets in code are different with paper).
Moreover all datasets are downloaded from https://networks.skewed.de/?tags=Multilayer .
